# Webscrapping
The main purpose of this repo is that I categorize several positions in IT fields and determine which one is the most recruited. 

So to do that, I try to do several steps, it is just some primary steps to scrap data from the web browser, and to have further detail, check the jupyter notebook that I describe above

Here are some steps that I develop to capture the data of job offering: 
1. I inspect my Data Source, in this case I use **Linkedin** for my resource
2. Then, I scrape HTML content from a Job Page of Linkedin
3. Finally, I parse HTML Code with a very strong library which is Beautiful Soup.
